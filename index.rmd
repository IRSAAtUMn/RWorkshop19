With the increasing availability of data with broad applications (and the sheer size of some of these data), it is more important than ever to be able to elucidate trends, decisions, and stories from data. Our team will offer a hands-on introduction to data science and statistics using the free and publicly available software R. Assuming no background in software or statistics, we will introduce you to some of the most useful, modern, and popular data analysis techniques.



TOPICS COVERED:

* Features of R and best practices for reproducible data science
* Constructing visualizations, wrangling data, and producing simple numerical summaries
* A gentle introduction to statistical modeling

# Welcome & Set-Up {-}

Welcome to IRSA's "Introduction to Reproducible Data Science with R"!  As you get settled in, please take the following steps to get set up for the workshop:

1. Introduce yourself to & meet the other students at your table.  Though workshop helpers will be floating around the room, we encourage you to support one another as you learn R.    

2. Open the workshop manual: https://irsaatumn.github.io/RWorkshop19/    

3. Open RStudio.    

4. Within RStudio, type the following into the console (lower left panel):

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    library("rmarkdown")
    library("knitr")
    library("ggplot2")
    library("dplyr")
    library("fivethirtyeight")
    library("car")
    library("glmbb")
    library("pacman")
    library("RColorBrewer")
    ```
    
    If you get any errors, this likely means that you have not yet installed the packages listed in the participant checklist.  If this is the case, type the following into the console:    
    
    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    install.packages(c("RColorBrewer", "knitr", "car", "ggplot2", "fivethirtyeight", "glmbb", "pacman", "rmarkdown", "dplyr"))
    ```
