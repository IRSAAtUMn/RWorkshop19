With the increasing availability of data with broad applications (and the sheer size of some of these data), it is more important than ever to be able to elucidate trends, decisions, and stories from data. Our team will offer a hands-on introduction to data science and statistics using the free and publicly available software R. Assuming no background in software or statistics, we will introduce you to some of the most useful, modern, and popular data analysis techniques.



TOPICS COVERED:

* Features of R and best practices for reproducible data science
* Constructing visualizations, wrangling data, and producing simple numerical summaries
* A gentle introduction to statistical modeling
